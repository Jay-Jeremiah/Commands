There is another way to add a user to the linux system. We can use the following commands:

	adduser username - Add a user to the system
	usermod -a -G sudo username - Assign the user to the sudo group
	chsh -s /bin/bash username  - Assigns a shell to the user

In Linux , we can perform the follwing on other users on the machine:
-Access,format files 
-make and delete directories 
-make downloads of packages using the terminal

All the above in the terminal, all wee need to do is use the command
	
	su - username

This command will prompt you for the password of the other user.
After inputing the password, you will access to the terminal of the other user.
