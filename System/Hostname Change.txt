Changing the hostname 
On the linux system, there is a file that holds the hostname 
called hostname which can be accessed using 'cat /etc/hostname' command.

We can just use a texteditor in the following ways:
    vi /etc/hostname
    press i to enter the insert mode
    edit the hostname and press the 'Esc' key
    save the work using ':wq!'
    Then reboot the linux machine.

Or we can use the command
    hostnamectl set-hostname newhostnme
    reboot
