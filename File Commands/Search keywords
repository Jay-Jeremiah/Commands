Incase we want to search for the different keywords in our files, we use the GREP and EGREP commands.

Grep - stands for "global regular expression print"
    This processes text line by line and prints a line that matches a specified pattern

SYNTAX:
    grep keyword filename - searches for the keyword in the filename.
    grep -c keyword filename - searches for the keyword and counts its occurences
    grep -i keyword filename - searches for the keyword irrepective of the case

awk - designed for data extraction.

Syntax:
    awk '{print $1}' file - list 1st field from the file
    awk '{print $1,$3}' file   - list 1st and 3rd field from file
    ls -l | awk '{print $1,$3}' list 1st and 3rd field from ls -l output
